# SENG 371 - Project 1
Software evolution research on an open-source project.
Jian Guan, Paul Moon, Jonathan Lam

### Project question
How does the rate of feature additions change as a project grows in size?

### Methodology (including the tools you expect to use)
We can use Gource to visualize the additions of features in the system. We can use GitHub API to measure the rate of feature additions based on the labels on pull requests, and also count the lines of code to approximate the size of the project.

### Codebases/Systems you will analyze
Using the methodology above, we will analyze three codebases:
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
- [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone)

### Project milestones
- By February 23, we will have a thorough analysis of these three repos showing Gource videos and statistics for answering the project question.
