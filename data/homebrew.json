I do this myself because I forget how to do certain things :)\r\nOn the mailing list Max asked to do a reference sheet. The suggestion then was to provide an example formula (this one here passes even `brew audit` although it is totally dysfunctional).\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we keep this formula up-to-date with the recommended API to write formulae. It is a kind of cheat sheet that shows more features than the wiki currently, though some aspects are more detailed in the wiki.\r\n\r\nStill few things missing and probably I did mistakes. Therefore I ask for review.\r\n\r\n### Todo:\r\n- [x] MPI stuff\r\n- [x] `depends_on :fortran`\r\n- [x] plist stuff. I don't know much about that.\r\n- [x] LanguageModuleDependency other than python\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "### Introduction\r\n\r\nTo avoid having multiple formulae with endings `-py2` and `-py3`, we will handle support for different pythons (2.x vs. 3.x) in the same formula. Further brewed vs. external python will be transparently supported.\r\n\r\nNew python Requirements:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndepends_on :python => :recommended\r\ndepends_on :python3 => :optional  # so --with-python3 option will be generated\r\n# or to declare a specific version:\r\ndepends_on PythonInstalled.new(\"2.6\")  \r\n```\r\n\r\nMost formulae should just work with this little change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The `python` object that will support formula dev\r\n\r\nIn the Formula class there will be a `python` object available (`python2` and `python3`, too), that supports some convenience methods which do the complicated work of figuring out the information no matter which python version or brewed vs. python from OS X:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npython.site_packages # the site-packages in the Cellar for the current formulae that will later be linked globally\r\npython.global_site_packages\r\npython.binary # the full path to the python binary. For brewed python: HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/python/bin/python2\r\npython.prefix\r\npython.version\r\npython.version.major\r\npython.version.minor\r\npython.xy # => e.g. \"python2.7\"\r\npython.incdir # includes of python\r\npython.libdir # the python dylib library\r\npython.pkg_config_path # used internally by brew\r\npython.from_osx?\r\npython.framework?\r\npython.universal?\r\npython.pypy?\r\npython.standard_caveats # The usual text to set PYTHONPATH that is only shown for python.from_osx?\r\npython.if3then3 # => \"\" for 2.x and to \"3\" for 3.x.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `python`, there is also `python2` and `python3` to explicitly refer to 2.x and 3.x resp..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Executing code only for 2.x or 3.x\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to\r\n```ruby\r\nif python2\r\n  # do something specific for python 2.x\r\nend\r\n\r\nif python3\r\n  # do something specific for python 3.x\r\nend\r\n\r\nunless python\r\n  # do something if there is no python (or python support was disabled --without-python --without-python3)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The `python do ... end` block\r\n\r\nAnd one of the most important features is the `python`-block which creates the `python.site_packages` dir and already sets the `PYTHONPATH` correctly. This block is executes **once for each python requirement**.\r\n\r\nFormulae that use a `setup.py` to install python bindings, can do \r\n```ruby\r\n\r\ndepends_on :python\r\ndepends_on :python3\r\n\r\npython do\r\n  # sets up PYTHONPATH and site-packages.\r\n  # The python object within this block points to the python 2.x in the first round\r\n  # and to 3.x in the second round.\r\n  system python, \"setup.py\", \"install\", \"--prefix=#{prefix}\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Are now all formulae automatically available for python 3.x?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nAdding Python 3.x support for individual formulae and testing that will take longer and I won't do this right now for all of the formulae. However, I did this for some to test things out.\r\n\r\n### Tasks:\r\n\r\n- [x] `depends_on :python` Requirement (python is a synonym for python2 here)\r\n- [x] `depends_on :python3` Requirement\r\n- [x] Write the correct sitecustomize.py also if the requirement is used.\r\n- [x] Improve sitecustomize.py so that multiple versions (and external) are better supported.\r\n- [x] Write the distutils.cfg if the requirement is used.\r\n- [x] Update Python formulae to reuse sitecustomize.py\r\n- [x] Allow formulae to use `setup.py --prefix=#{prefix}` instead of the complicated stuff as is.\r\n- [x] `pip` will install executable scripts to `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` (solves a few issues)\r\n- [x] Provide `python.standard_caveats`\r\n- [x] Add Python's pkg-config during build\r\n- [x] Use a temporary build environment to not touch stuff outside of the python block\r\n- [x] Provide `python.global_site_packages`\r\n- [x] Provide `python.binary` to indirect the call to python\r\n- [x] Replace `which_python` by `python.xy`\r\n- [x] Provide `python do` block \r\n- [x] Provide `python2 do` block which is only run if a python 2.x has been found and unless `--without-python`.\r\n- [x] Provide `python.incdir` (sometimes needed for cmake based projects)\r\n- [x] Provide `python.libdir` (sometimes needed for cmake based projects)\r\n- [x] Provide `python.version.major` and `python.version.minor`\r\n- [x] Provide `python.if3then3` which evaluates to \"\" for 2.x and to \"3\" for 3.x.\r\n- [x] Provide `python.framework` (is `nil` for non-framework builds)\r\n- [x] Provide `python.universal?`\r\n- [x] Provide `python.pypy?`\r\n- [x] Provide `python.brewed?`\r\n- [x] Provide `python.from_osx?`\r\n- [x] test :hg download strategy\r\n- [ ] Write test_python.rb\r\n- [ ] Do we want `brew create --python` ?\r\n- [x] Check that the user has not `python -> python3` symlink, which is not recommended.\r\n- [x] Update audit to tell people to use the blocks and requirements\r\n\r\nFormulae in homebrew core to update accordingly (list created via grep for python):\r\n- [x] bazaar\r\n- [x] beecrypt\r\n- [x] boost\r\n- [x] boost149\r\n- [x] bulk_extractor\r\n- [x] bup\r\n- [x] cantera\r\n- [x] cmu-sphinxbase\r\n- [x] collectd\r\n- [x] cracklib\r\n- [x] cvs2svn\r\n- [x] denyhosts\r\n- [x] diffuse\r\n- [x] disco\r\n- [x] discodex\r\n- [x] distcc\r\n- [x] duplicity\r\n- [x] enchant\r\n- [x] fail2ban\r\n- [x] fontforge\r\n- [x] fsh\r\n- [x] gdal\r\n- [x] git-cola\r\n- [x] git\r\n- [x] glade\r\n- [x] gnome-doc-utils\r\n- [x] google-app-engine\r\n- [x] gpsd\r\n- [x] grass\r\n- [x] grc\r\n- [x] gtk-doc\r\n- [x] io\r\n- [x] ldns\r\n- [x] ledger\r\n- [x] libcaca\r\n- [x] libdnet\r\n- [x] liblunar\r\n- [x] libming\r\n- [x] libplist\r\n- [x] libpst\r\n- [x] librets\r\n- [x] libstfl\r\n- [x] libxml2\r\n- [x] lilypond\r\n- [x] little-cms\r\n- [x] llvm\r\n- [x] lorem\r\n- [x] macvim\r\n- [x] mapnik\r\n- [x] mapserver\r\n- [x] mercurial\r\n- [x] node\r\n- [x] omni\r\n- [x] open-babel\r\n- [x] opencolorio\r\n- [x] orfeo\r\n- [x] oscats\r\n- [x] owfs\r\n- [x] pil\r\n- [x] portmidi\r\n- [x] postgres-xc\r\n- [x] postgresql\r\n- [x] py2cairo\r\n- [x] pyexiv2\r\n- [x] pygtk\r\n- [x] pygtkglext\r\n- [x] pygtksourceview\r\n- [x] pyqt\r\n- [x] pyqwt\r\n- [x] pyside-tools\r\n- [x] pyside\r\n- [x] python\r\n- [x] python3\r\n- [x] qscintilla2\r\n- [x] rabbitmq-c\r\n- [x] rabbitmq\r\n- [x] rdiff-backup\r\n- [x] rubber\r\n- [x] scons\r\n- [x] shiboken\r\n- [x] shocco\r\n- [x] sickbeard\r\n- [x] sip\r\n- [x] subversion\r\n- [x] swatchbooker\r\n- [x] thrift\r\n- [x] treeline\r\n- [x] uwsgi\r\n- [x] vim\r\n- [x] vte\r\n- [x] weechat\r\n- [x] wireshark\r\n- [x] wxmac\r\n- [x] xapian\r\n- [x] xchat\r\n- [x] yasm\r\n- [x] yle-dl\r\n- [x] zbar\r\n- [x] zookeeper\r\n",
