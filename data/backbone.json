With this setup, collections will never care about `model.id` and bookkeep purely by a customizable `Collection#generateId`. This means models can be in many collections and uniquely identified appropriately across all of them, all without having to alter the data in the model. After all, a model can't know how to distinguish itself from others in a collection as well as the collection can. This is a first draft, but I feel this may be the better way.\r\n\r\nRFC @jashkenas @braddunbar @tgriesser\r\n\r\nRE: #2976, #2985, #3080, #3132",

It's similar in plugability to `Backbone.ajax` or other overridable parts of Backbone.\r\n\r\nNative Views and non-jQuery DOM libraries would be able to create a native View implementation by overriding `$`, `make`, `remove`, `setElement`, `delegate`, and `undelegateEvents` (see the [NativeView reference implementation](https://github.com/akre54/Backbone.NativeView)). This preserves the majority of the public contract of View (with the notable exception of `View#$` and `view.$el`), and the public interface of the constructor (including passing options), `delegateEvents`/`undelegateEvents`, `render`, `remove`, and `setElement` would be virtually unchanged. The PR also re-adds `View#make`.\r\n\r\nThe next step would be to remove Backbone.$() calls from History and perhaps extend `View#setElement` and `View#make` to use a common exposed `createElement` utility.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Update for folks tuning in late**: The final list of overridable methods is [available on the wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Using-Backbone-without-jQuery) with instructions for how to use it in your own project.",

So I'm sorry for the poor re-issue etiquette, but I really think this should be at least discussed.\n\n`reset` definitely has it's place as a quick way to completely wipe a collection and start over with new models. Often times though, I'd like to update a collection without obliterating my current models but rather firing off helpful `add`/`change`/`remove` events. This allows me to poll the server with `fetch` and effectively listen for these events without fear of having to recreate any models (wasteful). Here is an example:\n\n```js\nvar UsersView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  delegateEvents: function () {\n    Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents.apply(this, arguments);\n    this.collection.on('add', this.addUser, this);\n    this.pollInterval = setInterval(_.bind(this.poll, this), 10000);\n  },\n  \n  undelegateEvents: function () {\n    clearInterval(this.pollInterval);\n    Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents.apply(this, arguments);\n  },\n  \n  addUser: function (user) {\n    var userView = new UserView({model: user});\n    this.$el.append((userView).el);\n  },\n  \n  poll: function () {\n    // Ideally `update` is the default action, but that would be a\n    // breaking change so the options object is used for now.\n    this.collection.fetch({update: true});\n  }\n});\n\nvar UserView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  initialize: function() {\n    // Can be fine tuned thanks to `change:attr`, but in general...\n    this.model.on('change', this.render, this);\n    this.model.on('remove', this.remove, this);\n  }\n});\n\nvar users = new Backbone.Collection();\nusers.url = '/users';\nvar usersView = new UsersView({collection: users});\n$('body').append(usersView.el);\nusersView.poll();\n```\n\nThis is not a complete example, but you can see what I'm getting at. The ability to rig a view (and subviews) this way makes for a clean, clear intent as to what should happen when an `add`/`change`/`remove` happens. The only alternative right now is a not-so-pretty `reset` dance that just doesn't use Backbone.Events to their potential.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the duplicate but I would really appreciate some input especially before the release is cut.",

With this setup, collections will never care about `model.id` and bookkeep purely by a customizable `Collection#generateId`. This means models can be in many collections and uniquely identified appropriately across all of them, all without having to alter the data in the model. After all, a model can't know how to distinguish itself from others in a collection as well as the collection can. This is a first draft, but I feel this may be the better way.\r\n\r\nRFC @jashkenas @braddunbar @tgriesser\r\n\r\nRE: #2976, #2985, #3080, #3132",

It's similar in plugability to `Backbone.ajax` or other overridable parts of Backbone.\r\n\r\nNative Views and non-jQuery DOM libraries would be able to create a native View implementation by overriding `$`, `make`, `remove`, `setElement`, `delegate`, and `undelegateEvents` (see the [NativeView reference implementation](https://github.com/akre54/Backbone.NativeView)). This preserves the majority of the public contract of View (with the notable exception of `View#$` and `view.$el`), and the public interface of the constructor (including passing options), `delegateEvents`/`undelegateEvents`, `render`, `remove`, and `setElement` would be virtually unchanged. The PR also re-adds `View#make`.\r\n\r\nThe next step would be to remove Backbone.$() calls from History and perhaps extend `View#setElement` and `View#make` to use a common exposed `createElement` utility.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Update for folks tuning in late**: The final list of overridable methods is [available on the wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Using-Backbone-without-jQuery) with instructions for how to use it in your own project.",

So I'm sorry for the poor re-issue etiquette, but I really think this should be at least discussed.\n\n`reset` definitely has it's place as a quick way to completely wipe a collection and start over with new models. Often times though, I'd like to update a collection without obliterating my current models but rather firing off helpful `add`/`change`/`remove` events. This allows me to poll the server with `fetch` and effectively listen for these events without fear of having to recreate any models (wasteful). Here is an example:\n\n```js\nvar UsersView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  delegateEvents: function () {\n    Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents.apply(this, arguments);\n    this.collection.on('add', this.addUser, this);\n    this.pollInterval = setInterval(_.bind(this.poll, this), 10000);\n  },\n  \n  undelegateEvents: function () {\n    clearInterval(this.pollInterval);\n    Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents.apply(this, arguments);\n  },\n  \n  addUser: function (user) {\n    var userView = new UserView({model: user});\n    this.$el.append((userView).el);\n  },\n  \n  poll: function () {\n    // Ideally `update` is the default action, but that would be a\n    // breaking change so the options object is used for now.\n    this.collection.fetch({update: true});\n  }\n});\n\nvar UserView = Backbone.View.extend({\n  initialize: function() {\n    // Can be fine tuned thanks to `change:attr`, but in general...\n    this.model.on('change', this.render, this);\n    this.model.on('remove', this.remove, this);\n  }\n});\n\nvar users = new Backbone.Collection();\nusers.url = '/users';\nvar usersView = new UsersView({collection: users});\n$('body').append(usersView.el);\nusersView.poll();\n```\n\nThis is not a complete example, but you can see what I'm getting at. The ability to rig a view (and subviews) this way makes for a clean, clear intent as to what should happen when an `add`/`change`/`remove` happens. The only alternative right now is a not-so-pretty `reset` dance that just doesn't use Backbone.Events to their potential.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the duplicate but I would really appreciate some input especially before the release is cut.",

This makes it difficult to fetch and insert a set of models that may contain both new and updated models. Maybe there's a different way to perform this task, but it wasn't obvious to me.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a merge flag to `Backbone.Collection.add`, which causes models with identical ids be passed as arguments to `Backbone.Model.set` instead of being discarded. In the case of true duplicates, the current behaviour is preserved (no change to the collection, no additional events fired), but updates to models retain the object in the collection, but update its attributes (firing the corresponding change events, unless silent).",

By sharing data between multiple versions of a callback list, we can achieve this while [preserving performance characteristics](http://jsperf.com/backbone-events-linked-list/5).",

The model is simply converted to a JSON string and sent in the body.  The HTTP method mapping in the documentation holds, with updates being sent as PUT requests and deletes as DELETE requests.\n\nIn order to support legacy end-points that don't support application/json in the body or PUT requests, or legacy browsers that will not recognize the PUT request, users can turn on `emulateHttp`.   This will do the following\n\n* For PUT and DELETE requests, they will be sent as POST, the right `_method` param will be put in the body, and an appropriate `X-Http-Method-Override` header will be added to the request.  This will guarantee safe routing in Rails 2.3 pre-rack routing.\n* Send the model as a `model` param in the body.\n* Always encode the body as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\nI got rid of the `emulateJSON` idea because in cases where it was needed, the flag `emulateHTTP` would also be needed and then questions would arise as to how they interact.  We don't want to cover all the possible uses cases.  We just want to provide one broad clean default option and one broad legacy option, and let the user override `Backbone.sync` if neither of them work.  Am I right?",
